# Document Content Summarizer implemented in LangGraph

This repository contains a custom Document Content Summarizer agent, developed using LangGraph and powered by Azure OpenAI GPT-4o model.

This agent is meant to be combined with the respective pipeline code developed as an enhancement to Open WebUI, and can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nepiskopos/open-webui-enhancements).

The system is designed to identify create a consise summary with the main and important points from unstructured text. It uses language model-driven reasoning combined with a graph-based flow for flexible and context-aware processing.

Features

    üîç Document Summarization: Summarizes document text content using GPT models with natural language reasoning.

    üß† LangGraph Orchestration: Utilizes LangGraph to define modular, stateful, and extensible detection workflows.

    ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure OpenAI Integration: Powered by GPT-4o or other Azure OpenAI models for high-accuracy analysis.

    üõ†Ô∏è Customizable Pipelines: Easily adaptable for sentiment analysis tasks.

    üì¶ Modular Design: Plug-and-play components to support experimentation or integration into larger systems.

This solution is based on more feature-rich version, developed during my time at [IBM](https://www.ibm.com), as part of the Digital Transformation project for the [National Bank of Greece (NBG)](https://www.nbg.gr/en/), where I was tasked with exploring and utilizing the LangGraph framework to meet complex enterprise needs.
